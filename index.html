    <p>Growing up in Minnesota, I was taught to two things:<br> bearing the cold and telling good stories.<br> I use this talent in my work as UX Researcher.<br>

      Specializing in UX Research and Design, I love <br> sitting down with users and filling in what their<br> side of the story looks like. With their help,<br> I build a comprehensive understanding, and solve <br> user problems before they become pain points. <br>
      
      To mention a few of the tools I use to get between <br> point A and point B, my skills include; Figma,<br> Miro, InVision, JIRA, Qualitative Interviews, <br> & Project Management.
      
      Let's create something beautiful that makes <br>the users' days a little brighter, together!</p>
